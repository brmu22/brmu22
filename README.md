# :postbox: About Me
My name is Bri and I'm a Computer Science major @ Morgan State University! üêª

```python
class Brianna:
    def __init__(self):
        self.traits = ["smart", "adventurous", "foodie"]

I have been interested in technology since about 12 years old, that's when I jailbroke my first iPad. I officially started off my coding journey in my freshman year of college, using C++ and eventually grew to learn Python and JavaScript. Now I am playing around with Web Design and Cloud, messing around with HTML, CSS, and AWS. I am continuously learning!
