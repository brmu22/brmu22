### Hi! I'm Brianna 👋🏽

# :sparkles: About Me
My name is Bri and I'm a Computer Science major @ Morgan State University! #GoBears! 🐻

```python
class Brianna:
    def __init__(self):
        self.traits = ["smart", "adventurous", "foodie"]
        self.hobbies = ["Coding!", "Gaming", "Working Out", "Sleeping"]
```

I have been interested in technology since about 12 years old, that's when I jailbroke my first iPad. I officially started my coding journey in my freshman year of college, using C++, and eventually grew to learn Python and JavaScript. Now I am playing with Web Design and Cloud, messing around with HTML, CSS, and AWS. I am continuously learning!
